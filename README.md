Integrating multiple MRI modalities for an automatic differential diagnosis between multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica
=====================

This repository provides code and data for a project on automatic differential diagnosis between MS and NMO.

_Please note the manuscript is under review, after which we will make data in form of R dataframes available_

Ther are two files here:
 
 - __codes.Rnw__ : including analysis codes used to provide our results
 - __data.RData__: data in R format
